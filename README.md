# Android_Malware_Detection_ML

In this project, we adopted machine learning to analyze
and identify malware features such as the permissions
requested by malware. Our focus in this project was to find
a small subset of permissions that could be used to classify
applications into their proper malware families.We used
Random Forest Classifier to identify and classify the
applications into malware or benign apps based on the
provided permissions.
